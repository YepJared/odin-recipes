    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Macaroni and cheese is a beloved comfort food that combines tender pasta with a rich, creamy cheese sauce. Typically made with elbow macaroni, the dish is known for its simple yet indulgent ingredients, often featuring a blend of cheeses like cheddar, mozzarella, or gouda. The cheese sauce is usually made by creating a roux—cooked butter and flour—before whisking in milk and cheese, resulting in a velvety texture that coats the pasta perfectly. Whether baked with a crispy breadcrumb topping or served straight from the stovetop, mac and cheese is a dish that evokes feelings of nostalgia and warmth.</p>
    <p>The versatility of mac and cheese is one of its most appealing aspects. It can be easily customized with a variety of ingredients, such as crispy bacon, sautéed vegetables, or gourmet cheeses, allowing for endless flavor combinations. Additionally, it can be prepared in various styles, from the classic stovetop version to a baked casserole topped with breadcrumbs or herbs. As a staple at family gatherings, potlucks, and even upscale restaurants, mac and cheese transcends age and culinary preference, making it a universally cherished dish that brings people together over hearty helpings of cheesy goodness.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 ounces (170 g) elbow macarone</li>
        <li>6 ounces (180 mL) evaporated milk</li>
        <li>6 ounces (170 g) grated mild or medium cheddar cheese, or any good melting cheese, such as Fontina, Gruyere, or Jack</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place macaroni in a medium saucepan or skillet and add just enough cold water to cover. Add a pinch of salt and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring frequently. Continue to cook, stirring, until water has been almost completely absorbed and macaroni is just shy of al dente, about 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Immediately add evaporated milk and bring to a boil. Add cheese. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring continuously, until cheese is melted and liquid has reduced to a creamy sauce, about 2 minutes longer. Season to taste with more salt and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
